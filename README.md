## Quick Start

1. **Copy this template** to your new project directory
2. **Review the setup guide** at `setup-guide.md`

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation as Infrastructure
Your documentation IS your organizational infrastructure. It should:
- Guide decision-making processes
- Create institutional memory
- Enable democratic participation
- Support movement building

### 2. Process Over Product
This template emphasizes:
- HOW you organize work (workflows)
- WHY you make decisions (rationale)
- WHO benefits from choices (politics)
- WHAT values guide development (movement alignment)

### 3. Adaptable Yet Consistent
While each project has unique needs:
- Core workflows remain consistent
- Movement values stay central
- Security practices are non-negotiable
- Documentation standards persist

## What Makes This Different

### Movement-Centered Design
- Built BY organizers FOR organizers
- Embeds anti-surveillance principles
- Prioritizes community ownership
- Challenges extractive tech patterns

### Canadian Context Aware
- Bilingual considerations built-in
- Privacy legislation compliance (PIPEDA/CASL)
- Electoral law awareness
- Regional hosting considerations

### Security Through Process
- Regular security review cycles
- Threat model documentation
- Privacy-preserving defaults
- Community data sovereignty
