# Campaign CRM Example

This example shows how the movement project template adapts to a political campaign CRM system.

## Domain Context

**Project Type**: Campaign Relationship Management System
**Users**: Campaign staff, volunteers, candidates
**Timeline**: Tied to election cycles
**Key Constraints**: Electoral law compliance, volunteer coordination, temporal urgency

## Template Adaptations

### 1. Threat Model Adjustments

The security threat model for campaign tools emphasizes:
- **Primary Threats**: 
  - Opposition research and infiltration
  - Donor/volunteer list theft
  - Disinformation attacks
- **Compliance Requirements**:
  - Electoral finance laws
  - Privacy legislation (PIPEDA/CASL)
  - Contribution limit tracking

### 2. Documentation Structure

```
tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Standard template
â”œâ”€â”€ todo.md                      # Sprint-based during campaign
â”œâ”€â”€ decisions.md                 # Technical decisions

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ post-campaign.md        # Wrap-up and archival
â””â”€â”€ archive/
```

### 3. Task Management Adaptations

Campaign CRMs use modified task tracking:

```markdown
# todo.md - Campaign Version

## Active Sprint: GOTV Prep
_Sept 15-22 - Goal: Ready for Get Out The Vote phase_

### ðŸš€ In Progress
- [ ] Implement canvassing quick-entry form
  - **Acceptance**: 15-second entry on mobile
  - **Campaign Priority**: CRITICAL for door knocking
  - **Assignee**: Ana
  - **Deadline**: Sept 18 (canvassing starts Sept 19)
```

### 4. Decision Documentation

Campaign-specific decisions include electoral context:

```markdown
## 2024-08-15: Donation Processing Integration

**Context**: Need to track donations for Elections Canada compliance

**Decision**: Integrate with [Payment processor] for automatic limit tracking

**Compliance Notes**: 
- Individual contribution limit: $1,675
- Real-time tracking required
- Receipts must be immediate

**Review Date**: Post-campaign (cannot change mid-campaign)
```

### 5. Security Enhancements

Campaign CRMs require additional security measures:

- Volunteer access controls (temporary, limited scope)
- Opponent research protection
- Rapid response procedures
- Data retention policies (7 years for financial)

### 6. User Story Patterns

Campaign-specific user stories:

```markdown
As a canvasser
I need to quickly enter contact information at the door
So that I can maintain conversation flow and cover more ground

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Entry takes < 15 seconds
- [ ] Works offline
- [ ] Syncs when connected
- [ ] Handles French names correctly
```

## Lessons from Real Campaigns

### What Works
1. **Temporal documentation** - Clear phase-based organization
2. **Rapid task cycles** - Daily updates during campaign
3. **Compliance first** - Built into every feature
4. **Volunteer-friendly** - Assume high turnover

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Over-engineering** - Campaigns need simple, working tools
2. **Ignoring mobile** - Most volunteers use phones
3. **Complex security** - Balance protection with usability
4. **Poor handoff** - Document for post-campaign transfer

### Key Metrics
- Contact entry time: < 30 seconds
- Volunteer onboarding: < 10 minutes
- System uptime: 99.9% during campaign
- Compliance accuracy: 100% required
