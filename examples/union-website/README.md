# Union Website Example

This example shows how the movement project template adapts to a union local's digital infrastructure needs.

## Domain Context

**Project Type**: Union Local Website & Member Portal
**Users**: Union members, stewards, executive, public
**Timeline**: Ongoing with surge periods (negotiations, strikes)
**Key Constraints**: Member privacy, employer surveillance, democratic governance

## Template Adaptations

### 1. Threat Model Adjustments

Union digital infrastructure faces specific threats:
- **Primary Threats**:
  - Employer surveillance of organizing
  - Union busting consultants
  - Member data exposure
  - Strike preparation secrecy
- **Protection Needs**:
  - Bargaining strategy confidentiality
  - Member contact lists security
  - Strike fund information
  - Organizing campaign protection

### 3. Task Management Adaptations

Union projects have regular work + campaign surges:

```markdown
# todo.md - Union Version

## Current Focus: Bargaining Preparation
_Jan 15-31 - Goal: Secure member portal ready for negotiations_

### ðŸš€ In Progress
- [ ] Implement secure document vault for bargaining committee
  - **Acceptance**: End-to-end encryption, executive-only access
  - **Security**: No employer access possible
  - **Assignee**: Jordan
  - **Labor Sensitivity**: HIGH - contains strategy docs

### ðŸ“‹ Ready to Start
- [ ] Anonymous workplace issue reporting system
  - **Acceptance**: Members can report without identification
  - **Purpose**: Document contract violations safely
  - **Privacy**: IP anonymization required
```

### 4. Decision Documentation

Union-specific decisions consider labor law and democracy:

```markdown
## 2024-12-10: Member Voting System

**Context**: Need secure, transparent voting for contract ratification

**Decision**: Build custom voting system vs use third-party

**Labor Law Consideration**: 
- Must maintain vote secrecy
- Requires auditable results
- Members only, verified against good standing

**Democratic Principles**:
- One member, one vote
- Transparent counting process
- Results verifiable by scrutineers

**Implementation**: Custom system with paper trail option
```

### 5. Security Enhancements

Union websites require special security measures:

- Member-only sections with strong authentication
- Employer IP blocking during sensitive periods
- Encrypted communication for organizing
- Secure document storage for grievances
- Anonymous reporting systems

### 6. User Story Patterns

Union-specific user stories:

```markdown
As a shop steward
I need to privately document workplace violations
So that we can build grievances without employer retaliation

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Mobile-friendly incident reporting
- [ ] Photo evidence upload capability
- [ ] Timestamp verification
- [ ] Encryption at rest
- [ ] Access limited to grievance committee
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Core Features

#### Member Portal Design
```markdown
## Access Levels

2. Member - Verified members only
3. Steward - Workplace representatives
4. Executive - Elected leadership
5. Staff - Union employees

## Verification Without Surveillance
- Member number + custom password
- No employer email addresses
- Optional 2FA via personal device
- Regular access audits
```

#### Strike Communication System
```markdown
## Requirements
1. Rapid broadcast capability
2. Works without employer networks
3. Picket line coordination
4. Strike pay administration
5. Encrypted leadership channels

## Implementation
- SMS for critical updates
- App works offline
- Mesh networking capability
- Paper backup systems
```

#### Democratic Features
```markdown
## Digital Democracy Tools

### Labor-Specific Security

#### Protecting Organizing
```
DURING ORGANIZING CAMPAIGNS:
âœ“ Enhanced access logging

âœ“ Encrypted organizer communications
âœ“ Automatic data expiration
âœ“ Legal hold capabilities

NEVER:
âœ— Log individual page views

```

#### Bargaining Security
```markdown
## Negotiation Period Protocols
1. Bargaining team secure vault
2. Strategy documents encryption
3. Proposal version control
4. Secure survey systems
5. Media embargo enforcement

## Technical Implementation
- Separate infrastructure for sensitive docs
- Air-gapped systems for critical data
- Regular security sweeps

### Decision Example

```markdown
## 2025-01-05: Employer Network Independence

**Context**: Members report employer blocking union site

**Decision**: Multi-channel access strategy

**Implementation**:
1. Primary: Standard web hosting
2. Mirror: Tor hidden service
3. Backup: Email-based system
4. Emergency: SMS gateway
5. Ultimate: Paper systems

**Rationale**: Employers cannot block all channels
**Cost**: Higher complexity accepted for resilience
```

## Lessons from Union Tech

### What Works
1. **Member-first design** - Not just "users"
2. **Democracy built-in** - Technical bylaws compliance
3. **Security culture** - Assume employer surveillance
4. **Solidarity features** - Cross-workplace communication
5. **Paper backups** - Not everyone is digital

### Common Challenges
1. **Multi-generational users** - Wide skill range
2. **Employer blocking** - Need resilient access
3. **Legal requirements** - Labor law compliance
4. **Resource constraints** - Union budgets tight
5. **Volunteer maintenance** - Plan for sustainability

### Success Metrics
- Member portal adoption rate
- Successful votes conducted
- Grievances filed digitally
- Security incidents: 0
- Strike communication reach: 100%

## Collective Bargaining Adaptations
