## What You've Created

A comprehensive organizational framework for progressive technology projects that embeds movement values and sustainable practices into the development process.

## Key Features

### 1. Process-Oriented Documentation
- **Decision tracking** that creates institutional memory
- **Security-as-process** with regular review cycles
- **Task management cascade** from strategic to tactical
- **Living documentation** that evolves with the project

### 2. Movement Values Embedded
- Democratic technology choices
- Community ownership patterns
- Privacy-preserving defaults
- Anti-surveillance design
- Accessibility-first approach

### 3. Flexible Yet Consistent
- Core workflows remain stable
- Domain-specific adaptations shown through examples
- Canadian political context awareness
- Scales from individual to coalition projects

### 4. Security Through Process
- Threat modeling templates
- Regular review schedules
- Privacy-first patterns
- Community protection focus

## Usage Pattern

1. **Copy template** to new project
2. **Review examples** matching your domain
3. **Adapt templates** using setup guide
4. **Maintain workflows** throughout development
5. **Archive learnings** for future projects

## What Makes This Different

### Not Just Files, But Workflows
- Shows HOW to organize work
- Demonstrates WHY decisions matter
- Illustrates WHO benefits from choices
- Explains WHAT values guide development

### Real-World Examples
Each example (campaign CRM, mutual aid, union, organizing toolkit) shows:
- Specific threat models
- Domain adaptations
- Governance patterns
- Success metrics
- Common pitfalls

### Built From Experience
Based on actual patterns from your candidate-crm project:
- Chronological decision logging
- Iterative security hardening
- User story driven development
- Task archival with lessons learned

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Start with organizational-patterns.md** to understand the philosophy
2. **Use setup-guide.md** for step-by-step implementation
3. **Study relevant examples** for domain-specific patterns
4. **Adapt templates** to your specific needs
5. **Contribute improvements** back to the movement

## Template Maintenance

This template should evolve through use:
- Document new patterns discovered
- Add examples from different domains
- Improve based on user feedback
- Keep movement values central
