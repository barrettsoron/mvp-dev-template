## Decision-Making Guidelines

### When to Document a Decision
- It affects system architecture
- It has security implications
- It's hard to reverse
- Team members disagreed
- It affects users significantly
- It involves significant cost/time

### Good Decision Documentation
- **Clear Context**: Anyone can understand why
- **Honest Trade-offs**: Document what we're giving up
- **Measurable Criteria**: Know when to revisit
- **User-Focused**: Connect to user needs
- **Time-Bound**: Set review dates

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ‚ùå Deciding without documenting
- ‚ùå Documentation after the fact
- ‚ùå Hiding negative consequences
- ‚ùå No review dates
- ‚ùå Technical jargon without explanation
