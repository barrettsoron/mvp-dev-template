## Movement-Specific Security Considerations

### Data Sovereignty
- User data export capabilities
- Clear data ownership policies
- No vendor lock-in for critical data
- Community-controlled backups

### Surveillance Resistance
- Minimize data collection
- No unnecessary tracking
- Clear consent processes
- Threat model includes state actors

### Collective Security
- Security education for all users
- Community incident response
- Transparent security practices
- Shared responsibility model
