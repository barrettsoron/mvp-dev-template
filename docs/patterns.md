# Organizational Patterns for Movement Technology

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Decision Documentation Pattern

**Purpose**: Create institutional memory and democratic accountability

**Structure**:
```yaml
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Decision: What was decided
Context: Why this decision was needed
Options_Considered:
  - Option A with pros/cons
  - Option B with pros/cons
Rationale: Why we chose this option
Impact: How this affects users/community
Review_Date: When to revisit this decision
```

**Daily Practice**: Document decisions AS they happen, include dissenting opinions, set review dates.

### 2. Task Management Cascade

**Purpose**: Connect strategic vision to daily work

**Three-Layer System**:
- **Strategic Layer**: User stories, long-term roadmap, cross-functional dependencies
- **Tactical Layer**: Current sprint tasks, concrete actionable items, clear acceptance criteria
- **Archive Layer**: Completed work documentation, lessons learned, performance metrics

**Workflow**: Strategic planning → User stories → Task breakdown → Current todo → Archive with learnings

### 3. Security-as-Process Pattern

**Purpose**: Iterative security improvement without perfection paralysis

**Regular Review Cycle**:
```bash
# Weekly: Dependency checks
npm audit / pip check / bundler audit

# Monthly: Access review
- Who has access to what?
- Are permissions still appropriate?

# Quarterly: Full security audit
- Credential exposure scan
- Input validation review  
- Authentication flow check
```

**Security Decision Framework**:
1. **Threat Model First**: Who are we protecting against?
2. **Movement Context**: State surveillance vs corporate extraction
3. **User Impact**: Security vs usability trade-offs
4. **Implementation Cost**: Perfect vs good enough
5. **Review Schedule**: When to reassess

## Movement-Specific Patterns

### 1. Ethical Software Development

**License Framework**: All projects governed by [Hippocratic License HL3-BDS-ECO-FFD](../LICENSE)
- Prohibits use for human rights violations, environmental destruction, or supporting oppression
- Requires ethical compliance throughout supply chain

**Implementation**:
- Include license badge prominently in documentation
- Regular ethical impact reviews alongside security audits
- Contributor agreement requires license compatibility
- Document ethical trade-offs in decision logs

### 2. Community Ownership Pattern

**Documentation Approach**: Plain language explanations, multiple examples, visual diagrams, glossary of technical terms

**Code Practices**: Extensive inline comments, example usage in every module, setup scripts that explain themselves, error messages that educate

### 3. Privacy-First Development Pattern

**Every Feature Considers**:
1. What data is actually needed?
2. How long must we keep it?
3. Who needs access?
4. Can it be anonymized?
5. Export/deletion capabilities?

**Documentation Requirements**: Data flow diagrams, retention policy matrices, access control lists, anonymization strategies

### 4. Coalition Technology Pattern

**When Multiple Organizations Share Infrastructure**:

**Governance Documentation**:
```yaml
Coalition_Members:
  - Organization A (role/responsibilities)
  - Organization B (role/responsibilities)
  
Decision_Process:
  Minor_Changes: Single org approval
  Major_Changes: Consensus required
  Emergency_Fixes: Any org can act
  
Data_Ownership:
  - Each org owns their data
  - Shared data requires agreement
  - Export rights guaranteed
```

## Documentation Workflow

### Daily
- Update todo.md with progress
- Note any blockers or decisions

### Weekly  
- Archive completed tasks
- Update technical decisions
- Review security alerts

### Per Feature
- Document in user story format
- Include acceptance criteria
- Note accessibility requirements
- Consider privacy implications

### Per Release
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Review all documentation
- Archive old decisions
- Plan next cycle

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Technical Anti-Patterns
- **Hero Developer Pattern**: One person knows everything → Solution: Pair programming, documentation requirements, rotation
- **Perfect is the Enemy Pattern**: Waiting for perfect security/features → Solution: Iterative improvement, documented trade-offs
- **Technical Solutionism Pattern**: Building tech for tech's sake → Solution: User story driven, community feedback loops

### Movement Anti-Patterns
- **Extraction Creep Pattern**: Gradually adding surveillance features → Solution: Regular values alignment reviews, community oversight
- **Surveillance features disguised as analytics**
- **Data hoarding beyond necessity**
- **Closed-source dependencies for core features**
- **Platform lock-in without exit strategy**

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Different Domains

**Campaign Tools**: Emphasis on temporal documentation, rapid iteration patterns, compliance checklists, volunteer onboarding

**Mutual Aid Platforms**: Privacy-first patterns, distributed governance docs, resource sharing protocols, community safety practices

**Union Organizing Tools**: Security hardening emphasis, legal compliance tracking, member democracy features, strike preparation modes

**Community Websites**: Accessibility-first patterns, multilingual considerations, sustainable hosting docs, community moderation

### For Different Scales

**Individual Projects**: Simplified todo tracking, personal decision journal, basic security checklist

**Small Teams**: Shared documentation, review processes, knowledge sharing

**Large Organizations**: Formal governance, audit trails, training programs

## Success Indicators

### Technical Health
- Documentation stays current
- New team members onboard quickly  
- Security improves over time
- Technical debt stays manageable

### Movement Alignment
- Communities own their data
- Features serve organizing needs
- Privacy preserved by default
- Democratic participation enabled

### Sustainability
- Multiple people can maintain
- Knowledge is preserved
- Burnout is prevented
- Growth is possible
